"testing" by "Till Meyer-Arlt"

When play begins:
say "[italic type]You are once again lost in a jungle far from home. You are ready to give up and go home, disappointed in yet another failed archaeological expedition. Just as you decide to turn back to camp, you suddenly stumble upon something...[roman type]".

The Forest is a room. "You stand in a clearing in the deep jungle. Obscured by centuries of overgrowth and dim sunlight is a ruined temple of some sort. Whatever details there may have been on the stone blocks have long since been worn away. There is a single, solitary entryway leading downward."

The House is a room. "The House... AHHHH"

The House is south of the Forest.
